    <p>PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open-source scripting language designed for web development. It was created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 as a set of Common Gateway Interface (CGI) binaries written in C. Over time, PHP evolved into a server-side scripting language with a focus on web applications and dynamic content generation. PHP has gone through several major releases, with the current stable version being PHP 8.x.</p>
